                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.

                    <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

                    <p>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                        
                    <p>Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                        
                    <p>This means that in the browser, JavaScript can change the way the webpage (DOM) looks. And, likewise, Node.js JavaScript on the server can respond to custom requests from code written in the browser.
                    </p>

                    <p>JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.

                    <pre>
    <code>
    let Fruh = "foobar"</code>
                    </pre>
                    
                    <p>But, the variable fruh is not the same as Fruh because JavaScript is case sensitive.

                    <p>In JavaScript, instructions are called statements and are separated by semicolons (;).

                    <p>A semicolon is not necessary after a statement if it is written on its own line. But if more than one statement on a line is desired, then they must be separated by semicolons

                    <p>he syntax of comments is the same as in C++ and in many other languages:
                        <pre>
    <code>
        // a one line comment

        /* this is a longer,
         * multi-line comment
         */

        /* You can't, however, /* nest comments
        */ SyntaxError  */
    </code>
                        </pre>
                        
                    <p>Comments behave like whitespace, and are discarded during script execution.</p>

                    <li>You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
                    <li>A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). Subsequent characters can also be digits (0–9).
                    <li>Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" (uppercase) as well as "a" through "z" (lowercase).</ul>

                    <header>Evaluating Variables</header>
                    <p>Evaluating variables A variable declared using the var or let statement with no assigned value specified has the value of undefined.

                    <p>An attempt to access an undeclared variable results in a ReferenceError exception being thrown:

<pre>
    <code>
    var a;
    console.log('The value of a is ' + a); // The value of a is undefined<br>

    console.log('The value of b is ' + b); // The value of b is undefined
    var b;
    // This one may puzzle you until you read 'Variable hoisting' below<br>

    console.log('The value of c is ' + c); // Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined<br>

    let x;
    console.log('The value of x is ' + x); // The value of x is undefined<br>

    console.log('The value of y is ' + y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
    let y;
    </code>
</pre>

                <p>You can use undefined to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable input is not assigned a value, and the if statement evaluates to true.

<pre>
    <code>
        var input;
    if (input === undefined) {
      doThis();
    } else {
      doThat();
    }
    </code>
</pre>

                <p>The undefined value behaves as false when used in a boolean context. For example, the following code executes the function myFunction because the myArray element is undefined:

<pre>
    <code>
    var myArray = [];
    if (!myArray[0]) myFunction();
    </code>
</pre>

                    <p>The undefined value converts to NaN when used in numeric context.

<pre>
    <code>
    var a;
    a + 2;  // Evaluates to NaN
    </code>
</pre>

                    <p>When you evaluate a null variable, the null value behaves as 0 in numeric contexts and as false in boolean contexts. For example:

<pre>
    <code>
    var n = null;
    console.log(n * 32); // Will log 0 to the console
    </code>
</pre>
                    
                </section>
                
            </main>
